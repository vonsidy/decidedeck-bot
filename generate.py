# rank has _fight_check; wyr had NOTHING, so a broken dilemma aired unchecked: "your
# crush LIKES your post" (a gift) vs "your crush LEAVES YOU ON READ" (a loss). One
# good option against one bad one is a free choice, not a dilemma — everyone picks
# the gift, so the made-up "76% chose being left on read" is nonsense and the video
# is dead. Two gates now, mirroring rank: a cheap deterministic pass for the obvious
# gift-vs-loss mismatch, then an AI backstop for the subtler ones.

# The mismatch is only detectable when we can read BOTH sides: a one-sided "this is
# a loss" test wrongly drops a real loss-vs-loss pair ("lose all your followers" vs
# "start your account over") because it can't tell the OTHER side is also a loss. So
# the gate fires only when one side is a clear GIFT and the other a clear LOSS.
