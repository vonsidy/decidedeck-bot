"""Generates a cartoon sticker for ANY option, so every card has art.

Why generate instead of searching a photo library
-------------------------------------------------
Most options aren't photographable. "Never do homework again" has no photo, and
a stock search for it returns junk (a real search for "be in your favorite movie"
returned a beer advert). Generation covers everything AND gives one consistent
look, instead of a mishmash of stock photos in different styles.

The catch, and the fix
----------------------
An image model can't interpret an abstract option either — prompted with the raw
text "never do homework again" it drew a kid DOING homework, and "being invisible"
drew a plainly visible girl. So the option is translated into something concrete
and drawable FIRST ("a happy kid throwing homework papers into the air"), which
renders perfectly. That translation comes from:
  1. `hint` — Claude writes one per option when it writes the question (generate.py)
  2. ART_HINTS — hand-written for the built-in pool
  3. the raw option text — fine for concrete things ("a pet dragon" is great)

Images are cached on disk and committed, so the cloud never regenerates (it's
~10-45s per image) and never ships art nobody reviewed.
