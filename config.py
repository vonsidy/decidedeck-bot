# It was meant to open a curiosity loop, but it spends the single most valuable

# answer yet, with a "BET YOU CAN'T CHOOSE" line over it — a hook that announces
# itself as a hook, which a scroller is trained to swipe. Then at 0.8s it vanishes
# and a DIFFERENT question appears, so anyone who did start reading is interrupted
# and has to start over. Owner's call, and the right one: open on round 1: a real
# question they can answer immediately, about their phone or their crush or school,
# earns the stop on relevance instead of asking for it.
#
# Removing the outro made it redundant anyway. The loop used to be
# end-card -> teaser; now it is final reveal -> teaser, which showed the last
# round's question again immediately after revealing its answer. Without the teaser

# --- Motion -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every frame drifts slowly instead of sitting still. The video was a slideshow of
# stills: nothing moved for the first 3.1s (the 0.8s teaser flash, then round 1's
# card while the question is read). A motionless opening frame reads as an image
# post on Shorts and gets swiped before the question lands, which wastes the hook
# copy entirely. Keep it SUBTLE — this should register as "alive", not as a zoom
# effect.
#
# The motion is a JELLY BOUNCE on each beat, not a slow drift. A new card or a
# countdown tick pops in slightly oversized and wobbles down to rest — the springy
# feel of a hand-edited Short, rather than a documentary pan. Owner's call: the
# slow zoom read as tasteful but sleepy.
#
# Beats are marked per segment in assemble.build (the 3rd element of seg_specs).
# The reveal count-up is deliberately NOT a beat: it is REVEAL_FRAMES segments
# inside half a second, and bouncing each one is what read as a shake. Those frames
# ride the tail of the preceding bounce.
#
#   zoom = MOTION_BASE + JELLY_POP * e^(-t/JELLY_DECAY) * cos(2*PI*t/JELLY_WOBBLE)
#
# JELLY_POP must stay BELOW MOTION_BASE-1.0: zoompan clamps zoom to >= 1, so a
# trough under 1.0 flattens into a stutter on exactly the springy frames.
#   bigger POP    = more bounce
#   longer DECAY  = wobbles for longer before settling
#   longer WOBBLE = slower, looser jelly; shorter = tighter, snappier
# A bounce alone still left the frame dead: the spring settles in ~0.8s but a card
# is up for ~2.3s, so most of its screen time was motionless — the "boring text
# just standing there" problem. DRIFT and SWAY run on absolute time and never
# settle, so the frame is always moving; the bounce rides on top as the punch.
#
# Peak zoom is MOTION_BASE+DRIFT_AMOUNT+JELLY_POP and is a CROP — push it too far
# and it eats the title. Trough is MOTION_BASE-DRIFT_AMOUNT-JELLY_POP and must stay
# above 1.0 or zoompan clamps it and the bounce stutters.
MOTION_BASE = float(get("MOTION_BASE", "1.055"))    # zoom the motion oscillates around

MOTION_FPS = int(get("MOTION_FPS", "30"))

# --- Panel entrance ------------------------------------------------------------
# The frame-level motion above moves the card as one flat image, so both boxes
# always travel together. This slides them in from OPPOSITE sides a beat apart, so
# they read as two separate objects — the thing that actually makes a Short look
# edited rather than animated.
#
# Sideways on purpose: the panels sit 16px under the header and just above the
# footer pill, so a vertical entrance slides a box straight over the title (tried
# it; it looks broken). Off the sides there is nothing to collide with.
#
# Frames are rendered by card.render rather than moved by a filter, because only
# card.render knows where the panels are. A cached render is ~35ms, so this costs
# about a second on a build that already takes minutes. Set PANEL_ENTRANCE=0 to
# turn it off. Skipped automatically when a round's intro is too short to hold it.
# --- Per-panel motion ----------------------------------------------------------
# Each box carries its own physics. This is the reason every frame is rendered
# rather than 10 stills being held: a filter over a finished frame can only move
# the card as one flat image, so both boxes would always do the same thing.
#
# BOB is a slow rise-and-fall, one period per panel. The periods are deliberately
# NOT multiples of each other, so the boxes drift in and out of phase forever
# instead of locking into step.
#
# SQUASH fires on each beat: the panels move TOWARD each other and spring back.
# Toward, because that is where the room is — the 200px VS gap. Outward would put
# panel A into the title and panel B into the footer pill within a few pixels.
#
# Both are small on purpose. The frame should feel alive; the moment a box travels
# far enough to make its label hard to track, the effect has cost more than it
# bought. BOB_PIXELS + SQUASH_PIXELS is the worst-case excursion — keep the sum
# under about 30px.
