"""Content for the kids fun-Shorts channel — all original, so it can monetize.

Five formats, all built around the same hook: show two things, count down, reveal
a percentage split (the % is made up on purpose — it's for fun and engagement).
`daily_item(format, date)` gives a stable-per-day pick so each day is fresh but a
day's video doesn't change between renders.
