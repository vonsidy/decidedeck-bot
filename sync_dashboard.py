"""Push kids.json to the dashboard repo, so the site shows this channel's data.

The dashboard is served from a DIFFERENT repo (youtube-shorts-bot) — this bot has
its own repo and only shares the site. Nothing links them automatically, so
without this step the dashboard silently freezes at whatever was last copied
across by hand while the bot happily keeps posting.

Uses the Contents API rather than cloning: it's one small file, and cloning the
dashboard repo (with its videos and art) to change one line would be absurd.

Needs DASHBOARD_TOKEN — a fine-grained token scoped to youtube-shorts-bot with
Contents: read+write, and nothing else. Never the account-wide token: a secret
that can do anything is a secret that can lose everything.
